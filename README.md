## Usage

Reactivity.logger = Rails.logger
Reactivity.stream_exceptions = true
```


Enabling the channel

```
# app/channels/reactivity_channel.rb
class ReactivityChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  include Reactivity::Channel
end
```


Linking models

```
# app/models/example.rb
class Example < ApplicationRecord
  include Reactivity::Hooks
end
```


Client side

```
// TODO: api still being worked on.
// Not quite certain of the balance between simplicity and flexibility
// Right now feel the focus should be functionnality and we can just do a small breaking change at some point

// For now, it looks like that:

reactivity = new Reactivity( function () {

    // Registration
    collection = reactivity.getCollection('example');

    // Callback
    changeHandle = collection.onChange( function (data) {
      console.log("Change callback called");
    });

    // Subscription
    subscriptionHandle = collection.subscribe({ pos_x: { lt: 25 }});

    // Callback Stop
    setTimeout( function () {
      changeHandle.stop();
    }, 5000);

    // Subscription Stop
    setTimeout( function () {
      subscriptionHandle.stop();
    }, 10000);
});
```
